Please use the makefile to build the program.

Run expr.c and enter the expression when prompted to test the parser. Once an expression is entered, it will parse the expression using both Recursive Descent Parser and Table Driven Parser.
The calculator is integrated into the RecursiveDescentParser with a function named ‘evaluate’ and the result is printed right after the tree. Only the Recursive Descent Parser has the calculation function.
I did the table driven parser and my partner did recursive descent parser and the calculator.
